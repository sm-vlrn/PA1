# A. ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM
The program first asks the user to enter a word. After that, the word is broken down into individual letters by turning it into a list. These letters are then arranged in alphabetical order using the sort function. Finally, the program shows the letters in their sorted order as the result.
# B. EMOTICON PROBLEM
The program begins by asking the user to type a sentence. It has a dictionary that connects certain words with their matching emoticons, such as “smile” being “:)”. The program checks if these words are found in the sentence, and if they are, it replaces them with the correct emoticon. At the end, the updated sentence with emoticons is displayed.
# C. UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM
The program starts with a list of numbers. The first number is saved as “first”, the numbers in between are grouped together as “middle”, and the last number is saved as “last” through unpacking. After organizing them into these three parts, the program prints all of them in one line.
